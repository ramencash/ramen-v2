# ramen-v2
Ramen.Cash is a social experiment that wishes to provide opportunities for the greater community to be involved in the market.
Within the industry, information and opportunities are too often controlled by the bigger players (whales and institutions), putting most of the community at a disadvantage.


We wish to change this by providing a token that is 100% fairly distributed to the community, that will give token holders the chance to participate in current market trends such as yield-farming and rebasing tokens.
